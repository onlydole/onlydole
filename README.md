## What I Do

I wear two hats at Merly. I lead product engineering while serving as Chief of Staff. I focus on infrastructure tools that drive innovation. Whether it's managing Kubernetes at scale, building AI systems, or creating developer experiences that inspire joy, I am dedicated to making the impossible possible.

### My Journey So Far

- **Currently**: Head of Product Engineering & Chief of Staff at Merly AI - Building cutting-edge AI infrastructure
- **Previously**: Head of Ecosystem at CNCF - Worked with 160+ companies including Apple, Intuit, and Mercedes-Benz
- **Before that**: Lead SRE at Disney Studios - Kept the magic running behind the scenes

## What Drives Me

ðŸŒŠ **Cloud Native**: Still deeply passionate about Kubernetes and the cloud native ecosystem. I contribute to projects, speak at conferences, and love helping teams navigate their cloud journeys.

ðŸ¤– **AI Infrastructure**: Exploring the intersection of AI and infrastructure - how we build, deploy, and scale the systems that power tomorrow's intelligence.

ðŸ“š **Learning**: Always have a book in hand. Currently fascinated by psychology, systems thinking, and the occasional sci-fi novel that makes me question everything.

## Let's Connect

I love connecting with fellow builders, dreamers, and infrastructure nerds. Whether you want to chat about Kubernetes, AI, or the best hikes in LA.
