# Hey, I'm Taylor Dolezal

**Head of Open Source @ [Dosu](https://dosu.dev)**
Los Angeles, CA

I've spent my career refactoring complex systems into intuitive platforms and helping teams ship incredible products. I'm passionate about the intersection of infrastructure, AI, and community. I've had such a fun career! Giving opening keynotes at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon, running production systems at Disney Studios, and helping enrich the end user ecosystem at CNCF.

## What I'm Good At

**Open Source Leadership.** I champion sustainable contributor programs and governance at Dosu. I've learned so much stewarding communities across CNCF and Merly.

**Cloud Native Operations.** I design resilient Kubernetes platforms and enable platform engineering teams. My time as an SRE at Disney Studios and as a Developer Advocate at HashiCorp shaped how I think about this stuff.

**Community Building.** I create welcoming experiences through summits, working groups, and contributor education. Helping maintainers and newcomers thrive is something I genuinely love.

**AI and Infrastructure.** I connect product teams, researchers, and practitioners to ship reliable tooling that accelerates intelligent applications.

## Currently Focused On

**Cloud Native.** Still deeply passionate about Kubernetes and the cloud native ecosystem. Whether it's conference stages or working groups, I love helping teams navigate their cloud journeys and build resilient systems.

**AI Infrastructure.** Exploring how we build, deploy, and scale the systems that power intelligence. The pace is whirlwind, and I'm here for it.

**Open Source Stewardship.** Growing inclusive contributor experiences, aligning community roadmaps, and celebrating the humans behind the code.

**Learning.** Always have a book in hand. Currently fascinated by psychology, systems thinking, and the occasional sci-fi novel that makes me question everything.
