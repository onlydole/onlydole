# Hello, I'm Taylor 👋

Based in sunny Los Angeles, I've spent my career making complex systems simple and helping teams ship amazing things.

## What Drives Me

🌊 **Cloud Native**: Still deeply passionate about Kubernetes and the cloud native ecosystem. I contribute to projects, speak at conferences, and love helping teams navigate their cloud journeys.

🤖 **AI Infrastructure**: Exploring the intersection of AI and infrastructure - how we build, deploy, and scale the systems that power tomorrow's intelligence.

📚 **Learning**: Always have a book in hand. Currently fascinated by psychology, systems thinking, and the occasional sci-fi novel that makes me question everything.

## Let's Connect

I love connecting with fellow builders, dreamers, and infrastructure nerds. Whether you want to chat about Kubernetes, AI, or the best hikes in LA.
