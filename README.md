## Core Expertise

- 🧭 **Open Source Leadership**: Championing sustainable contributor programs and governance at Dosu while applying lessons from stewarding communities across CNCF and Merly.
- ☁️ **Cloud Native Operations**: Designing resilient Kubernetes platforms, enabling platform engineering teams, and sharing pragmatic guidance from years in production environments.
- 🤝 **Community Building**: Creating welcoming experiences through summits, working groups, and contributor education that help maintainers and newcomers thrive.
- 🤖 **AI & Developer Infrastructure Strategy**: Connecting product teams, researchers, and practitioners to ship reliable tooling that accelerates intelligent applications.

## What I'm Focused On

🌊 **Cloud Native**: Still deeply passionate about Kubernetes and the cloud native ecosystem. I contribute to projects, speak at conferences, and love helping teams navigate their cloud journeys.

🤖 **AI Infrastructure**: Exploring the intersection of AI and infrastructure—how we build, deploy, and scale the systems that power tomorrow's intelligence.

👐 **Open Source Stewardship**: Growing inclusive contributor experiences, aligning community roadmaps, and celebrating the humans behind the code.

📚 **Learning**: Always have a book in hand. Currently fascinated by psychology, systems thinking, and the occasional sci-fi novel that makes me question everything.
