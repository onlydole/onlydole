# Hey, I'm Taylor Dolezal

**Head of Open Source @ [Dosu](https://dosu.dev)** | Los Angeles, CA

I've spent my career making complex systems simple and helping teams ship amazing things. From delivering the opening keynote at KubeCon EU to 10,000+ attendees, to running production systems at Disney Studios, to building contributor programs at CNCF — I'm passionate about the intersection of infrastructure, AI, and community.

### What I Bring to the Table

| Area | What I Do |
|------|-----------|
| **Open Source Leadership** | Championing sustainable contributor programs and governance at Dosu, with lessons learned from stewarding communities across CNCF and Merly |

### Currently Focused On

**Cloud Native** — Still deeply passionate about Kubernetes and the cloud native ecosystem. From conference stages to working groups, I help teams navigate their cloud journeys and build resilient systems.

**AI Infrastructure** — Exploring how we build, deploy, and scale the systems that power intelligence. The pace is whirlwind, and I'm here for it.

**Open Source Stewardship** — Growing inclusive contributor experiences, aligning community roadmaps, and celebrating the humans behind the code.

**Learning** — Always have a book in hand. Currently fascinated by psychology, systems thinking, and the occasional sci-fi novel that makes me question everything.
