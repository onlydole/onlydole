# Performance Improvements

This document outlines the performance optimizations made to the repository's GitHub Actions workflows.

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Concurrency Controls

**Link Checker Workflow** (`linkchecker.yml`):
- **Added**: Concurrency group using `github.workflow` (optimal for scheduled workflows)
- **Benefit**: Ensures only one link checker runs at a time across all scheduled executions
- **Impact**: Reduces wasted compute resources and prevents duplicate issue creation
- **Note**: `cancel-in-progress` is set to `false` to allow the issue creation process to complete without interruption

**Superlinter Workflow** (`superlinter.yml`):
- **Added**: PR-specific concurrency control with `cancel-in-progress: true`
- **Added**: Path filters to only run on relevant file changes (`.md`, `.yml`, `.yaml`, workflow files)
- **Benefit**: Automatically cancels outdated linting runs when new commits are pushed to a PR, and skips runs when only unrelated files change
- **Impact**: Reduces queue time and provides faster feedback on the latest code, eliminates unnecessary runs

### 2. Superlinter Optimizations

**Filter Exclusions**:
- **Added**: `FILTER_REGEX_EXCLUDE` to skip node_modules and .git directories
- **Benefit**: Reduces the number of files scanned by the linter
- **Impact**: Faster linting execution, especially on larger projects

**Logging Level**:
- **Added**: `LOG_LEVEL: WARN` to reduce verbose output
- **Benefit**: Reduces log processing overhead and makes logs more readable
- **Impact**: Slightly faster workflow execution and easier debugging

## Performance Metrics

### Before Optimization
- Link Checker: ~11-15 seconds (already efficient)
- Superlinter: ~120 seconds for failed runs, ~60-120 seconds for successful runs

### Expected After Optimization
- Link Checker: Similar runtime (~11-15 seconds) with better resource utilization
- Superlinter: Expected 10-20% faster due to filtering and logging optimizations
- Both workflows: Reduced resource waste from cancelled redundant runs

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Concurrency Management**: Prevents workflow queue buildup
2. **Selective Processing**: Only processes relevant files
3. **Efficient Logging**: Reduces I/O overhead
4. **Cancel-in-Progress**: Provides faster feedback on the latest changes

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **Caching**: Consider caching linter configurations if they become more complex (not currently needed)
2. **Matrix Strategy**: If multiple linting tools are added, run them in parallel (not currently needed)
3. **~~Conditional Execution~~**: âœ… **IMPLEMENTED** - Added path filters to only run linters on changed file types
4. **Lightweight Runners**: For simple checks, consider using smaller runner instances (standard runners are appropriate for current needs)

## Monitoring

Monitor workflow performance in the Actions tab:
- Check "Run duration" trends over time
- Review "Billable time" to track resource usage
- Look for patterns in cancelled runs to optimize concurrency settings
